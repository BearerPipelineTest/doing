(As part of plugin documentation I need to document some of the methods and objects available. More details coming... eventually. I kinda doubt anyone actually has any use for the plugin architecture, it was mostly me trying to figure out a better way to do it than what I had with my old Slogger project... it's weird that you're even reading this.)
